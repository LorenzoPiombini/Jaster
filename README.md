# ðŸš€ Jaster  
### *The FAST JSON Parser That Makes You Sweat (Just a Little)*

---

## âœ… What Is Jaster?

**Jaster** is a **zero-allocation**, **blazing-fast**, **JSON parser** written in **C**.  
It doesnâ€™t give you a cozy DOM or some bloated abstraction.  
It gives you **raw power**.  
You bring your structs.  
You map your data.  
And you break a sweatâ€”just enough to earn it. 

---

## âœ… Why Jaster Exists  
Because you:
- Don't need `malloc()`.
- Donâ€™t want 3rd party bloat.
- Want control.
- Want **speed**.

and I needed a fast parser for one of my porject, I was leaking memory everywhere,  
the memory usage of the application was increasing, so the one I wrote was pure garbage,
I decided to rethink it and this is it, it is a very simple parser, it basically traverses the **JSON** string.

## âœ… Jaster Culture ðŸ˜‚
- **No mallocs were harmed** in the making of this parser.  
  But your brain might be.
  
- **Jaster doesnâ€™t care about your hand.**  
  It wonâ€™t hold it.  
  You need to **think before you parse**.
